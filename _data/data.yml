education:
  - degree: The Art and Science of <br/> 2D & 3D <br/> Video Game Programming <br/> (Foundation Year)
    university: '[Digipen](https://www.digipen.edu/about/our-history){: target="_blank"}'
    location: 'Vancouver, Canada'
    time: 1997 ~ 1998
    details: >-
      I attended [DigiPen in Vancouver, British Columbia](https://www.digipen.edu/about/our-history){: target="_blank"} for the first year. 
      I routinely studied technology, complex algorithms and mathematics.
      That knowledge was then applied to theoretical situations and programming applications.
      
      Example: Mario and Luigi are sitting inside cannons on oppposite sides of the screen.
      The cannons have slightly different angles. What power levels do the cannons need to be
      and when does each cannon need to be fired in order to get Mario and Luigi to meet mid-air?
      
      I found the course to be both fun and challenging.
      
      As the school was migrating to the United States, I decided to continue my studies 
      on my own before pursuing a career in the games industry overseas.
