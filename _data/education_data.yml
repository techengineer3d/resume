      <p>I attended the game development school <b>Digipen</b> in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</p>
      <p>While there, I routinely studied technology, complex algorithms, mathematics and programming.</p>
      <p>Together with a small group of students, I learned to work as a team to create a game project.</p>
      <p>As the school intended to migrate to the United States, I decided to continue my studies independently.</p>
